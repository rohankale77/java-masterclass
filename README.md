# Java Masterclass

## Overview

This repository contains my **structured Core Java learning and practice modules**.
Each module focuses on a specific Java concept and is organized as a separate folder for clarity and scalability.

The purpose of this repository is to **practice Java fundamentals**, maintain clean source control, and track learning progress using Git and GitHub.
